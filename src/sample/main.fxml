We also aim to make our application be as accurate as possible about the information by making the application refresh frequently to ensure the information is updated more often. The main objectives we are trying to achieve is to use as many methods and features that we learned in this course and implement them in our design; we would also like to achieve a userfriendly design that is simple and easy to interact with. By the end of our design we hope that it would help whoever uses it to be updated regularly about information regarding the spread of COVID-19." textAlignment="JUSTIFY" wrappingWidth="646.0" AnchorPane.leftAnchor="36.0" AnchorPane.rightAnchor="38.0">
